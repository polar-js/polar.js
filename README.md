Polar.js is a WebGL-based game engine we wrote back in highschool.
This [video](https://youtu.be/ZVPHzbGP_gs) is a good showcase of what it can do.

## Getting Started
```js
// Add some example code here
```

## Usage
### Web
```html
<script src="unpkg.com/polar.js/umd/polar.min.js"></script>
```
The package is hosted on npm, so can be easily accessed through the [UNPKG CDN](https://unpkg.com/). For the latest minified version use the example above or specify a semver version (i.e. `unpkg.com/polar.js@1.0.0/polar.min.js`). Please refer to the [UNPKG site](https://unpkg.com/) for more details.

### Npm
```
npm install polar.js
```
Alternatively, you can bundle the engine with your app seperately by downloading the package with npm.
