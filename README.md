Polar.js is a quick, intuitive and easy 2D game engine developed in TypeScript for use on the web. It uses WebGL at a low level to deliver performance and an entity component system to ensure scalability and ease of development.

## Getting Started
```js
// Add some example code here
```

## Usage
### Web
Include `polar.min.js` into your web project.
```html
<script src="unpkg.com/polar.js/umd/polar.min.js"></script>
```
The package is hosted on npm, so can be easily accessed on the UNPKG CDN. 
For the latest minified version the example above or see [the UNPKG site](https://unpkg.com/) for more options and versions of the engine.

### Nodejs
Alternatively the package can be bundled with your app, and is available on npm to install.
```
npm install polar.js
```

## Examples
Some basic examples of what was made with the engine can be found here *link to other github and gh pages with some examples on*
