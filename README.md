Polar.js is a quick, intuitive and easy 2D game engine developed in TypeScript for use on the web. It uses WebGL at a low level to deliver performance and an entity component system to ensure scalability and ease of development.

## Getting Started
```js
// Add some example code here
```

## Usage
Include `polar.min.js` into your web project.
```html
<script src="polar.min.js"></script>
```
